## Prompt: Identify three distinct articulations of posthumanism ##

   In her 1999 work, How we Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles presents a genealogy of the influences mid-century cybernetic thinking has had on both the way technologies of information and “the biological, social, linguistic, and cultural changes that initiate, accompany, and complicate their development” (p. 29) is articulated as “informatics” (Hayles borrows this context of the term from Donna Haraway) and the simultaneous cultural reproduction of an informatics ontology in science fiction literature. For Hayles, the arrival of the “posthuman” through cybernetic discourse marks the loss of embodiment which she argues “has been systematically downplayed or erased in the cybernetic construction of the posthuman”  (4). Arthur Kroker frames Hayles’ posthuman subject(ivity) as the almost deterministic, “ideological reflex of computation in the age of complexity” (Body Drift 74). This ideological reflex, according to Hayles, is the result of the production of “flickering signifiers” in complexity theory and computational sciences which ultimately allow discursive products such as language, thought, and consciousness to be reduced to an issue of code, and to be presumed immaterial. Such dematerialization, she argues, marks an “epistemic shift toward complexity theory’s pattern/randomness dichotomy and away from presence/absence” (29), where pattern/randomness shows its roots clearly in the tradition of informatics and seems to dominate the vestiges of modern, post-Enlightenment, post-Cartesian presence/absence epistemic views. 

   It is these competing dualisms that define Hayles’ ultimate articulation of the progeny of cybernetic theory and the predominantly literary posthuman subject as able to achieve distributed consciousness “through recursive feedback loops cycling between different [and multiple] levels of coding” (279) that is, a subject of multiplicity which finds subjectivity mediated across numerous virtual systems of informatics (technological, biological, social). As Hayles is critical of literary figuring of this posthuman subject that fails to return to a material/embodied grounding of the conscious subject, this mediation across informatics is necessary for Hayles’ articulation of the posthuman subject to refigure itself into a discourse between both the dominant pattern/randomness dialectic that imploded virtuality with immateriality and the presence/absence dialectic which “connects materiality and signification in ways not possible within the pattern/randomness dialectic. To be useful,” Hayles argues, “the map of the posthuman needs to contain both dialectics” (pp. 247-248).
A second articulation of the posthuman subject, which appears in a number notable works predating Hayles’ How We Became Posthuman is the subject of “floating identities” (Stone 3). Though distributed consciousness and floating identities share their genealogical roots in the poststructuralist “multiplicities” from Deleuze’s and Guattari’s Capitalism and Schizophrenia, the articulation of the posthuman subject as floating identities has figured itself, I would argue, resolutely in practice, performance, and pleasure with the works of thinkers like Halberstam and Livingston, Stone, and Foster. Where Hayles’ argues that the distributed consciousness of the posthuman subject needs to contend with its own erasure of materiality, Judith “Jack” Halberstam and Ira Livingston remind us in Posthuman Bodies that the posthuman subject, virtual as it may be, are still embodied, and that “Posthuman bodies are the causes and effects of postmodern relations of power and pleasure, virtuality and reality, sex and its consequences…it is, as we shall see, a queer body” (“Introduction” 3). This articulation of the posthuman body assumes from the beginning an irreducible relationship between the signified, discursive subject and its embodied experience. However, this does not preclude the posthuman subject of floating identities from participation in cybernetic/computing systems. In The War of Desire and Technology, Allucquère Rosanne “Sandy” Stone, frames computing systems and their virtual environments as “arenas  for social experience and dramatic interaction, a type of media more like public theater, and their output is used for qualitative interaction, dialogue, and conversation. Inside the little [computer] box are other people” (16). Here, the complexity of virtual systems/information-reduced-to-code from the cybernetic posthuman Hayles’ contends with and the performative nature of interaction, dialogue, and all other embodied, lived, artifacts of sociality implode into a posthuman subject whose identity is fragmented and floating across mediated systems, but whose gestures of performance and pleasure are always material and embodied.

   In The Souls of Cyberfolk, Thomas Foster engages with the posthuman, cyborg figure as a subject of floating identities Stone’s use of “warranting” as “the production and maintenance of [a] link between a discursive space and a physical space” (Stone qtd in Foster 138). The necessity for this link is made more obvious by virtual reality computer interfaces precisely to the extent that they exaggerate the separation between these two spaces to previously unheard-of lengths.” (138). Guided by warranting, as production and maintained between the dichotomous physical/virtual of floating identity, Foster analyses the graphic novel series, Deathlok which traces the cyb(er)/(org) diaspora of  the Michael Collins/Deathlok character. Through a post-colonial/critical race lens, Foster is able complicate the articulation of the posthuman subject as “floating identities” by reminding us that virtuality and fragmented movements through subjectivity can be experienced as racial violence as floating identity can read as diaspora and that “racial performances in cyberspace seem to blur the distinction between passing and blackface …to the extent that white people as well as blacks must pass as white to be recognized as such in the absence of their bodies, and black people as well as whites must put on a kind of blackface to be recognized as black (167). Though embodied production and performativity is a necessary component of the “floating identities” articulation of the posthuman, and a component starkly missing from Hayles’ “distributed consciousness” articulation, Foster’s work, in the tradition of Fanon, does not mistake posthuman embodied performance, as ironic as it may be, for a pleasurable or even innocent dialectic between the discursive and material production of identity.
	
   A third, though not final articulation is not one of the “posthuman subject,” but rather one of “posthumanism” as the onto-epistemological successor to post-Enlightenment humanist rationality. Cary Wolfe’s What is Posthumanism? provides a genealogy of “posthumanist” thought and its various recursions of and divergences from humanist tendencies. Citing Bromstrom, Wolfe traces contemporary instantiations of transhumanism as a direct descendant of “Renaissance humanism and the Enlightenment” with its emphasis on “human perfectability and rationality” (xiii) as achieved through practices of “empirical science and critical reason” (p. xiv).  In this way, the genealogical history to transhumanist posthumanism is presented as the logical precursor to Hayles’ posthuman subject born from the cybernetic age. However, Wolfe is quick to dismiss transhumanist ideals as the "posthumanism" of his concern because of transhumanist tendencies to reproduce Enlightenment rationality, combined with futurists' dreams of extropian technologies without exercising its own protocols of "critical reason" against its own system of philisophical production.
	
   Instead, Wolfe's work pushes the boundaries of posthumanist thought past the physical/virtual boundary work of Stone and Foster, and past the pattern/randomness dialectic that Hayles’ argues has caught the cybernetically-born posthuman. Rather, Wolfe tends to dismiss the question of the “posthuman subject” altogether in favour of presenting the onto-epistemological characteristics of “posthumanism” which is inspired by an almost Derridean deconstruction through the critical reflexivity of systems theory. A critically reflexive posthumanism becomes a necessarily ethical argument. For Wolfe, “...posthumanism means not the triumphal surpassing of or unmasking of something, but an increase in the vigilance, responsibility, and humility that accompany living in a world so newly, and differently, inhabited” (47). This response-ability (in the Harawayan sense) to the system/environment relation rings similar to Stone's warranting as “a different way of conceptualizing the relationship to the human body” (Stone, 40). However, Wofe pushes the boundaries of relation further than Stone's physical/virtual duality and opens the terrain of posthumanist critique to include all cultural, social, and psychic production within explicitly non-humanist (post-humanist) ontological positionings across environments.
