## *Gender Trouble*, Judith Butler. 1990.

*"The question of 'the subject' is crucial for politics, and for feminist politics in particular, because juridicial subjects are invariably produced through certain exclusionary practices that do not "show" once the juridicial structure of politics has been established. In other words, the political construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimating and exxlusionary aims, and these political operations are effectively concealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridicial structurs as their foundation. Juridicial power inevitably 'produces' what it claims merely to represent; hence, politics must be concerned with this dual function of power: the juridicial and the productive. In effect, the law produces and then conceals the notion of "a subject before the law" in order to invoke that discursive formation as a naturalized foundational premise that subsequently legitimates that law's own regulatory hegemony." (p. 3)*

*"Within feminist political practice, a radical rethinking of the ontological constructions of identityappears to be necessary in order to formulate a representational politics that might revive feminism on other grounds. On the other hand, it may be time to entertain a radical critique that seeks to free feminist theory from the necessity of having to construct a single or abiding ground which is invariably contestes b those identity positions or anti-identity positions that it invariable excludes." (p. 7)

*"To what extent do *regulatory practices* of gender formation and division constitute identity, the internal coherence of the subject, indeed, the self-identical status of the person?..Inasmuch as 'identity' is assured through the stabilizing concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality, the very notion of 'the person' is called into question by the cultural emergence of those 'incoherent' or 'discontinuous' gendered beings who appear to be persons but who fail to conform to the gendered norms of cultural intelligibility by which persons are defined." (p. 23)

*"For Wittig, language is an instrument or tool that is in no way misogynist in its structures, only in its applications. For Irigaray, the possibility of another language or signifying economy is the only way to escape the 'mark' of gender which, for the feminine, is nothing but the phallogocentric erasure of the female sex...Wittig is clearly attuned to the power of language to subordinate and exclude women. As a 'materialist,' however, she considers language to be "another order of materiality," an institution that can be radically transformed." (p. 36)*

*"Although he argues in *The History of Sexuality* that sexuality is coextensive with power, he failsto recognize the concrete relations of power that both construct and condemn Herculine's pleasures as the 'happy limbo of non-identity' (xiii), a world that exceeds the categories of sex and identity...The use of this juridicial model presumes that the relation between power and sexuality is not only ontologically distinct, but that power always and only works to subdue or liberate a se whcih is fundamentally intact, self-suffiecient, and other than power itself. When 'sex' is essentialized in this way, it becomes ontologically immunized frmpower relations and from its historicity. As a result, the analysis of sexuality is collapsed into the analysis of 'sex,' and any inquiry into the historical production of the category of 'sex' itself is precluded by this inverted and falsifying causality." (p. 129)*
