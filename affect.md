## *Gender Trouble*, Judith Butler. 1990.

*"The question of 'the subject' is crucial for politics, and for feminist politics in particular, because juridicial subjects are invariably produced through certain exclusionary practices that do not "show" once the juridicial structure of politics has been established. In other words, the political construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimating and exxlusionary aims, and these political operations are effectively concealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridicial structurs as their foundation. Juridicial power inevitably 'produces' what it claims merely to represent; hence, politics must be concerned with this dual function of power: the juridicial and the productive. In effect, the law produces and then conceals the notion of "a subject before the law" in order to invoke that discursive formation as a naturalized foundational premise that subsequently legitimates that law's own regulatory hegemony." (p. 3)*
