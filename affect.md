## *Gender Trouble*, Judith Butler. 1990.

*"The question of 'the subject' is crucial for politics, and for feminist politics in particular, because juridicial subjects are invariably produced through certain exclusionary practices that do not "show" once the juridicial structure of politics has been established. In other words, the political construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimating and exclusionary aims, and these political operations are effectively concealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridicial structurs as their foundation. Juridicial power inevitably 'produces' what it claims merely to represent; hence, politics must be concerned with this dual function of power: the juridicial and the productive. In effect, the law produces and then conceals the notion of "a subject before the law" in order to invoke that discursive formation as a naturalized foundational premise that subsequently legitimates that law's own regulatory hegemony." (p. 3)*

- *Gender Trouble* largely regards the question of the gendered subject and its production, surveying and problematizing theories on sex and gender by thinkers, Beauvoir, Irigaray, Foucault, Kristeva and Wittig. Largely, Butler seems to agree with the fundamentals of a Foucauldian reading of sex as an *effect* of power structures, and further posits that "the being of gender" (45) are the phenomenological mimetic effects of a hegemonic ontology which constructs gendered and sexed subjects through its politics (often, discursively). This mimesis, Butler argues, also produces homosexuality and gender non-conformity as "parodic repition" of the symbolic "orginal" (i.e., the hegemonically produced heterogeniety) (43). 

- Of course, these productions are part of what Butler famously concludes to be performance; that is, (re)productions of gender stabilize or subvert this cultural hegemony. Butler reminds us that not all parodic repetitions are subversive (189).

- In this passage, Butler adopts Foucauldian language to describe the "juridicial structure" of power and politics. This structure, and its juridicial subjects are both inside of the system (producing social realities) and outside of the system (which conceals the subject-relation to the system in order to "invoke that discursive formation as a naturalized foundational premise that subsequently legitimates that law's own regulatory hegemony" (3). The juridicial system that Butler describes here demonstrates precisely the reflexivity of systems presented by Wolfe in *What is Posthumanism* to the effect of a relationship between subject and identity in which one variable always presupposes and reproduces the other (referred to as the "chicken-egg" problem by Johnson in "Sorting Out the Question of Feminist Technology")

- In this sense, efforts by Irigaray, Wittig, and Foucault to locate the causality of a subject in language (gendered language) or discourse which presupposes the subject as sex are insufficient because language/discursive acts because the production of the gendered self is not the effect of a unilateral relation to a univocal language.

*"Within feminist political practice, a radical rethinking of the ontological constructions of identity appears to be necessary in order to formulate a representational politics that might revive feminism on other grounds. On the other hand, it may be time to entertain a radical critique that seeks to free feminist theory from the necessity of having to construct a single or abiding ground which is invariably contestes b those identity positions or anti-identity positions that it invariable excludes." (p. 7)

*"To what extent do *regulatory practices* of gender formation and division constitute identity, the internal coherence of the subject, indeed, the self-identical status of the person?..Inasmuch as 'identity' is assured through the stabilizing concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality, the very notion of 'the person' is called into question by the cultural emergence of those 'incoherent' or 'discontinuous' gendered beings who appear to be persons but who fail to conform to the gendered norms of cultural intelligibility by which persons are defined." (p. 23)

- The call for a radical rethinking of "the ontological constructions of identity" while simultaneously entertaining a critique which liberates feminist theory from essentialism can be answered through interpretations of posthumanism as "fragmented identities" (see Halberstam and Livingston's *Posthuman Bodies*, 1995). In this genealogical reading, *Gender Trouble* can be seen as a prehistory to the intersections of queer theory and posthuman thought with their shared core tenets on embracing multiplicity of identity over essentialism, pleasure over domination, ironic/parodic subversion over hegemony, and a necessary rethinking of Cartesian mind/body dualism in favour of embodied ontoepistemology.

- Particularly, Butler's attempts to disrupt the construction of the subject (one understood as an artifact of humanism) (26) resonates with the work on posthumanist thinking that was paradigmatically concurrent with Butler's writing.

*"For Wittig, language is an instrument or tool that is in no way misogynist in its structures, only in its applications. For Irigaray, the possibility of another language or signifying economy is the only way to escape the 'mark' of gender which, for the feminine, is nothing but the phallogocentric erasure of the female sex...Wittig is clearly attuned to the power of language to subordinate and exclude women. As a 'materialist,' however, she considers language to be "another order of materiality," an institution that can be radically transformed." (p. 36)*

*"Although he argues in *The History of Sexuality* that sexuality is coextensive with power, he fails to recognize the concrete relations of power that both construct and condemn Herculine's pleasures as the 'happy limbo of non-identity' (xiii), a world that exceeds the categories of sex and identity...The use of this juridicial model presumes that the relation between power and sexuality is not only ontologically distinct, but that power always and only works to subdue or liberate a sex which is fundamentally intact, self-suffiecient, and other than power itself. When 'sex' is essentialized in this way, it becomes ontologically immunized from power relations and from its historicity. As a result, the analysis of sexuality is collapsed into the analysis of 'sex,' and any inquiry into the historical production of the category of 'sex' itself is precluded by this inverted and falsifying causality." (pp. 128-129)*

- Wittig's materialist view that language is "another order of materiality" provides a starkly different view of discourse and materiality than the Foucauldian views of the body as discursive. That is, a materialist reading of Foucault would understand that while the body produces and is produced by discourse, such discursive productions are not simply limited to language and cultural abstractions; they have embodied, somatic, psychic effects. In *How We Became Posthuman*, Hayles' critiques Foucault for not a focusing on embodiment and the "instantiated enactments that create feedback loops between materiality and discourse" (Hayles 195). While Wittig and Hayles both take on materialist views of discourse, Hayles' feedback loops place the material/discourse relation in a dialectical opposition where each of materiality and discourse are unique forces stuck in a co-production with each other. On the other hand, Wittig makes no disctinction between the two, seeing language as a type of materiality. 

- Hayles understanding of materiality as distinguishable from discourse suggests that for her, subversion might take place at the intervention of discourse (the floating signifier) and that the material itself is adiscursive, asymbolic, and apolitical (see Winner "Do Artifacts Have Politics"), and thus that, should the feedback loop break, material artifacts might be able to exceed its discursive limitations (if only until it is yoked to another discoursive feedback loop). 

- Foucault makes just this argument about the 19C "hermaphrodite," Herculine. Butler argues against Foucault that one cannot "exceed" the discursive limitations of sex and identity. Of course, in the case of gender it becomes clear that one cannot differentiate between the gendered body and the discursive power that produces it. Thus, Hayles' notion of the feedback loop between materiality and discourse is insufficient to theorize identity because the subject can never be severed or isolated from its signification as "subject."
