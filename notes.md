## *Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times*, Nicole Shukin. 2009.

*"...animal capital resists both culturalist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an economy and fetishism of signs and materialist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an econloy and fetishism of substances." (p. 6)*

Shukin is writing in between the traditions of biopolitical thought from Foucault, Derrida, and Agamben and Marxist thought from Delueze and Hardt and Negri. However, Shukin sees "animal capital's" rationality not in a cltural-semiotic fetishism of signs, nor in a materialist approach to to account for substance/the sum of the parts of animal capital. Instead, Shukin writes in the middle/mediating process of re-mediating/"rendering." This is a transient and transformative process at the boundries between sign and substance/language and life.

*"...animals reduced to 'mere jelly' even as they are contradictorily rendered in lively signs of technolpgical mobility." (p. 86)*

Uses Negri's "mere jelly" (defines her use on p. 83) as theoretical groundwork for process of animal rendering, both figuratively and literally. Shukin's examples of this process include "automobility" (cars-as-animals/Fordist industrialization), "telemobility" (Telus animals/Galvani's frogs, Eddison's Topsy), and "biomobility" (Animal Copyright/zoonotic diseases).

## *Body Drift: Butler, Hayles, Haraway*, Arthur Kroker. 2012.

*"There is no longer, if there ever was, a single, binding, universal history of the body, nor is it possible to speak today of the body as a cohesive singularity . . . Body drift refers to the fact that we no longer inhabit *a* body in any meaningful sense of ther term but rather occupy a multiplicity of bodies--imaginary, sexualized, disciplined, gendered, laboring, technologically augmented bodies. Moreover, the codes governing behaviour across this multiplicity of bodieshave no real stability but they themselves are in drift--random, fluctuating, changing." (p. 2)*

Kroker has taken on the formidable task of contending with three seminal feminist thinkers in the contemporary Western tradition. Kroker traces each of Butler's, Hayles', and Haraway's novel refusals of genealogies of gender and sexuality, computational chaos and order, and the violence of capital-colonial scientific thinking (turns which push these three thinkers from the traditions of the postmodern (via groundwork in Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Marx)and toward the posthuman) in relation to their treatments of re-writing embodiment ontologies. In tracing these three thinkers' refusals of a genealogical treatment of the singular, human, material body, *Body Drift* foils its critique as it stands as its own, albeit incomplete, genealogy of posthuman embodiment.

**Contingencies (Butler)**

*"Oscillating wildly between hyperaesthetics and excremental culture, the body desperately clings to any floating signs: the signs of death, panic, fear; the signs of insecurity and instability; but perhaps also the signs of new a multiplicity that is struggling to be born, exist and thrive." (p. 38)*

*"Neither a liberal humanist committed to abstract universalism nor a poststructural deconstructionist, Butler occupies a third space in the theorization of power. Silently streaming her thought with other nomadic thinkers before her, she sets out to *undo* interpellation, to *undermine* signification, to *work through* bad conscience, and to do this in a way that is neither universal nor particular but deeply reflexive. (p. 42)*

Re: Butler's understanding of the body as a site of grieving and becoming. Here embodiment is operating as a function of signs, particularly transitory signs (the drift in "body drift") that do not, and cannot, commit to any singular signification. For Kroker, Butler's "posthuman" theorization of bodies and power manifests itself in her refusal to commit to the body as a singular and complete site of power. Rather, Kroker argues that Butler's evading of, and navigating counter to, reifications of power in interpellation, signification, and the nihilism of Nietzsche's "bad conscience" establishes the body as a multiplicity always in a transient form.

**Complexities (Hayles)**

**Hybridities (Haraway)**
