## *Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times*, Nicole Shukin. 2009.

*"...animal capital resists both culturalist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an economy and fetishism of signs and materialist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an econloy and fetishism of substances." (p. 6)*

Shukin is writing in between the traditions of biopolitical thought from Foucault, Derrida, and Agamben and Marxist thought from Delueze and Hardt and Negri. However, Shukin sees "animal capital's" rationality not in a cltural-semiotic fetishism of signs, nor in a materialist approach to to account for substance/the sum of the parts of animal capital. Instead, Shukin writes in the middle/mediating process of re-mediating/"rendering." This is a transient and transformative process at the boundries between sign and substance/language and life.

*"...animals reduced to 'mere jelly' even as they are contradictorily rendered in lively signs of technolpgical mobility." (p. 86)*

Uses Negri's "mere jelly" (defines her use on p. 83) as theoretical groundwork for process of animal rendering, both figuratively and literally. Shukin's examples of this process include "automobility" (cars-as-animals/Fordist industrialization), "telemobility" (Telus animals/Galvani's frogs, Eddison's Topsy), and "biomobility" (Animal Copyright/zoonotic diseases).

## *Body Drift: Butler, Hayles, Haraway*, Arthur Kroker. 2012.

*"There is no longer, if there ever was, a single, binding, universal history of the body, nor is it possible to speak today of the body as a cohesive singularity . . . Body drift refers to the fact that we no longer inhabit *a* body in any meaningful sense of ther term but rather occupy a multiplicity of bodies--imaginary, sexualized, disciplined, gendered, laboring, technologically augmented bodies. Moreover, the codes governing behaviour across this multiplicity of bodieshave no real stability but they themselves are in drift--random, fluctuating, changing." (p. 2)*

Kroker has taken on the formidable task of contending with three seminal feminist thinkers in the contemporary Western tradition. Kroker traces each of Butler's, Hayles', and Haraway's novel refusals of genealogies of gender and sexuality, computational chaos and order, and the violence of capital-colonial scientific thinking (turns which push these three thinkers from the traditions of the postmodern [via groundwork in Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Marx] and toward the posthuman) in relation to their treatments of re-writing embodiment ontologies. In tracing these three thinkers' refusals of a genealogical treatment of the singular, human, material body, *Body Drift* foils its critique as it stands as its own, albeit incomplete, genealogy of posthuman embodiment.

**Contingencies (Butler)**

*"Oscillating wildly between hyperaesthetics and excremental culture, the body desperately clings to any floating signs: the signs of death, panic, fear; the signs of insecurity and instability; but perhaps also the signs of new a multiplicity that is struggling to be born, exist and thrive." (p. 38)*

*"Neither a liberal humanist committed to abstract universalism nor a poststructural deconstructionist, Butler occupies a third space in the theorization of power. Silently streaming her thought with other nomadic thinkers before her, she sets out to *undo* interpellation, to *undermine* signification, to *work through* bad conscience, and to do this in a way that is neither universal nor particular but deeply reflexive. (p. 42)*

Butler's understanding of the body as a site of grieving and becoming: Here embodiment is operating as a function of signs, particularly transitory signs (the drift in "body drift") that do not, and cannot, commit to any singular signification. For Kroker, Butler's "posthuman" theorization of bodies and power manifests itself in her refusal to commit to the body as a singular and complete site of power. Rather, Kroker argues that Butler's evading of, and navigating counter to, reifications of power in interpellation, signification, and the nihilism of Nietzsche's "bad conscience" establishes the body as a multiplicity always in a transient form.

**Complexities (Hayles)**

*"Hayles raises once again the challenge of any vision of the humanities that would be paradigmatic, namely, how to construct the creative posthuman subject out of the Charybdis of (modern) chaos and (posthuman) complexity, while avoiding the Scylla of (postmodern) catastrophe and (hypermodern) crash." (p. 67)*

*"In essence, *posthuman subjectivity is the ideological reflex of computation in the age of complexity.* Considered *ontologically,* it is as if complexity theory actually grew a body, extending itself into the human sensorium by means of a computational mind (made flesh) seeking to expand the transformative possibilities of digital culture. Understood *epistemologically,* posthuman subjectivity is a probability function, refusing determinism in favor of a form of consiousness operating by analogy. Viewed *socially* posthuman subjectivity can only fully realize itself by creative strategies of intermediation, discovering how different media can finally communicate with one another. And finally, neither a constructivist nor a realist, the posthuman subject is always in active aesthetic rebellion against the binary of logos - absence, struggling instead to surface the complex materiality that is pattern-randomness." (p. 74)*

Kroker's Hayles has tackled the balancing act of theorizing the posthuman subject out of the chaotic pattern-randomness ubiquity of data and its complexities, while turning away from nihilistic tendencies toward "catastrophe" and "crash" that Kroker attributes to the postmodern and hypermodern, respectively. This posthuman subject, while Kroker argues "refus[es] determinism" is also perceived as "*the* ideological reflex" (emphasis added) to an age of computational complexity. For Kroker, this reflexivity is not limited to the existensial qua ontological. Rather the posthuman subject also emerges epistemologically and socially, as a slippery being engaged in endless poesis of intermediation, transformation, and rebellion of a "binary of logos-absence."

**Hybridities (Haraway)**
