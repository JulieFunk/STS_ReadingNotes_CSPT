## *Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times*, Nicole Shukin. 2009.

*"...animal capital resists both culturalist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an economy and fetishism of signs and materialist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an econloy and fetishism of substances." (p. 6)*

Shukin is writing in between the traditions of biopolitical thought from Foucault, Derrida, and Agamben and Marxist thought from Delueze and Hardt and Negri. However, Shukin sees "animal capital's" rationality not in a cltural-semiotic fetishism of signs, nor in a materialist approach to to account for substance/the sum of the parts of animal capital. Instead, Shukin writes in the middle/mediating process of re-mediating/"rendering." This is a transient and transformative process at the boundries between sign and substance/language and life.

*"...animals reduced to 'mere jelly' even as they are contradictorily rendered in lively signs of technolpgical mobility." (p. 86)*

Uses Negri's "mere jelly" (defines her use on p. 83) as theoretical groundwork for process of animal rendering, both figuratively and literally. Shukin's examples of this process include "automobility" (cars-as-animals/Fordist industrialization), "telemobility" (Telus animals/Galvani's frogs, Eddison's Topsy), and "biomobility" (Animal Copyright/zoonotic diseases).
