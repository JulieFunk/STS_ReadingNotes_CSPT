## *Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times*, Nicole Shukin. 2009.

*"...animal capital resists both culturalist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an economy and fetishism of signs and materialist tendencies to reduce capitalism to an econloy and fetishism of substances." (p. 6)*

- Shukin is writing in between the traditions of biopolitical thought from Foucault, Derrida, and Agamben and Marxist thought from Delueze and Hardt and Negri. However, Shukin sees "animal capital's" rationality not in a cltural-semiotic fetishism of signs, nor in a materialist approach to to account for substance/the sum of the parts of animal capital. Instead, Shukin writes in the middle/mediating process of re-mediating/"rendering." This is a transient and transformative process at the boundries between sign and substance/language and life.

*"...animals reduced to 'mere jelly' even as they are contradictorily rendered in lively signs of technolpgical mobility." (p. 86)*

- Uses Negri's "mere jelly" (defines her use on p. 83) as theoretical groundwork for process of animal rendering, both figuratively and literally. Shukin's examples of this process include "automobility" (cars-as-animals/Fordist industrialization), "telemobility" (Telus animals/Galvani's frogs, Edison's Topsy), and "biomobility" (Animal Copyright/zoonotic diseases).

## *Body Drift: Butler, Hayles, Haraway*, Arthur Kroker. 2012.

*"There is no longer, if there ever was, a single, binding, universal history of the body, nor is it possible to speak today of the body as a cohesive singularity . . . Body drift refers to the fact that we no longer inhabit *a* body in any meaningful sense of ther term but rather occupy a multiplicity of bodies--imaginary, sexualized, disciplined, gendered, laboring, technologically augmented bodies. Moreover, the codes governing behaviour across this multiplicity of bodieshave no real stability but they themselves are in drift--random, fluctuating, changing." (p. 2)*

- Kroker has taken on the formidable task of contending with three seminal feminist thinkers in the contemporary Western tradition. Kroker traces each of Butler's, Hayles', and Haraway's novel refusals of genealogies of gender and sexuality, computational chaos and order, and the violence of capital-colonial scientific thinking (turns which push these three thinkers from the traditions of the postmodern [via groundwork in Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Marx] and toward the posthuman) in relation to their treatments of re-writing embodiment ontologies. In tracing these three thinkers' refusals of a genealogical treatment of the singular, human, material body, *Body Drift* foils its critique as it stands as its own, albeit incomplete, genealogy of posthuman embodiment.

**Contingencies (Butler)**

*"Oscillating wildly between hyperaesthetics and excremental culture, the body desperately clings to any floating signs: the signs of death, panic, fear; the signs of insecurity and instability; but perhaps also the signs of new a multiplicity that is struggling to be born, exist and thrive." (p. 38)*

*"Neither a liberal humanist committed to abstract universalism nor a poststructural deconstructionist, Butler occupies a third space in the theorization of power. Silently streaming her thought with other nomadic thinkers before her, she sets out to *undo* interpellation, to *undermine* signification, to *work through* bad conscience, and to do this in a way that is neither universal nor particular but deeply reflexive. (p. 42)*

- Butler's understanding of the body as a site of grieving and becoming: Here embodiment is operating as a function of signs, particularly transitory signs (the drift in "body drift") that do not, and cannot, commit to any singular signification. For Kroker, Butler's "posthuman" theorization of bodies and power manifests itself in her refusal to commit to the body as a singular and complete site of power. Rather, Kroker argues that Butler's evading of, and navigating counter to, reifications of power in interpellation, signification, and Nietzsche's "bad conscience" nihilism, establishes the body as a multiplicity always in a transient form.

**Complexities (Hayles)**

*"Hayles raises once again the challenge of any vision of the humanities that would be paradigmatic, namely, how to construct the creative posthuman subject out of the Charybdis of (modern) chaos and (posthuman) complexity, while avoiding the Scylla of (postmodern) catastrophe and (hypermodern) crash." (p. 67)*

*"In essence, *posthuman subjectivity is the ideological reflex of computation in the age of complexity.* Considered *ontologically,* it is as if complexity theory actually grew a body, extending itself into the human sensorium by means of a computational mind (made flesh) seeking to expand the transformative possibilities of digital culture. Understood *epistemologically,* posthuman subjectivity is a probability function, refusing determinism in favor of a form of consiousness operating by analogy. Viewed *socially* posthuman subjectivity can only fully realize itself by creative strategies of intermediation, discovering how different media can finally communicate with one another. And finally, neither a constructivist nor a realist, the posthuman subject is always in active aesthetic rebellion against the binary of logos - absence, struggling instead to surface the complex materiality that is pattern-randomness." (p. 74)*

- Kroker's Hayles has tackled the balancing act of theorizing the posthuman subject out of the chaotic pattern-randomness ubiquity of data and its complexities, while turning away from nihilistic tendencies toward "catastrophe" and "crash" that Kroker attributes to the postmodern and hypermodern, respectively. This posthuman subject, while Kroker argues "refus[es] determinism" is also perceived as "*the* ideological reflex" (emphasis added) to an age of computational complexity. For Kroker, this reflexivity is not limited to the existensial qua ontological. Rather the posthuman subject also emerges epistemologically and socially, as a slippery being engaged in endless poesis of intermediation, transformation, and rebellion of a "binary of logos-absence."

**Hybridities (Haraway)**

*"Definitely not a historian of science in the strict sense nor an aspirant to social utopia, Haraway makes of her own thought a knot of hybridities. This might explain why she can so fully, and powerfully, reveal the logic of scientific nihilism without once explicitly evoking the concept itself . . . Haraway exemplifies the double logic at the heart of nihilism can conjure up apocalyptic visions of a deracinating technological logic seeking to reduce nature and (social) natural to a passive instrumentality in the service of what Nietzsche alluded to as the 'nothingness within,' then nihilism also has an opposite, transformative dimension . This would be the singular contrubution of Heidegger's Nietzsche: that nihilism is itself the essential destiny of contemporary (Western) being because there is always, and only, a space for discovering the 'in-dwelling' of technology within the materiality of its most despotic moments." (p. 103)*

- Kroker's analysis of Haraway rounds out the final third of *Body Drift's* genealogy of feminist posthuman thought's refusal of a nihilistic determinism within an increasingly technological world-logic. Haraway's move is toward a posthuman subject of co-mingling and hybridities. Haraway's countersciences focuses on speculative fabulations/speculative feminisim (Note, my use of some of the "SFs" from *Staying with the Trouble* [2016] is achronistic to *Body Drift* [2012]). Rather than the corrosive futures of science and technology under absolute and apocolyptic power regimes, Haraway's posthuman move is to rework the very logical structure of the science-subject-power triad until it is what Kroker calls "a knot of hybridities."

## *Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science*, Kim Tallbear. 2013

*"Readers will frequently ecnounter the idiom of 'coproduction,' a key STS analytical tool that explains natural and social orders as coproduced. That is, science and technology are explained as actively entangles with social norms ans hierarchies...'science' and 'society' are mutually constitutive, meaning one loops back to in to reinforce, shape, or disrupt the actions of the other...Coproduction facilitates abd helps make sense of what could otherwise be a very confusing multidisciplinary analysis of the emergence of Native American DNA as a complex social and scientific object. In terms of Native American DNA, it problematizes a realist approach to understanding the object. Native American DNA is not simply 'naturally determined; it becomes manifest as scientists observe the movement of particular nucleotides via human bodies across time and space...The presence of such DNAs is sometimes also used by scientists and consumers to forge consequential identity connections between human bodies across time and space." (pp. 11-12)*

*"The concept of articulation is also invoked in these pages, a framework traced to two prominent cultural studies scholars, James Clifford and, before him, Stuart Hall. Like coproduction, the articulation framework complicates overly dichotomous views of phenomena as either essentially determined of overly constructed or invented, thereby implying a lack of 'realness'...[Articulation] focuses on cultural practices and knowledges as sometimes borrowed, interpreted, and reconfigured. Indeed, dynamism in cultural practice and identity formation is a sign of being alive, another key claim that indigenous peoples consistently make. They have survived. They are still here...A second key component of the articulation framework, and the reason it is helpful in relation to this subject, is its focus on power...Perhaps the genetic articulation of indigeniety will become also an *indigenous* articulation as trives increasingly move toward DNA parentage testing within a discourse of sovereignty"(p. 13)*

- Tallbear points to the importance of a particular STS technique and a framework, namely "coproduction" (as technique) and "articulation" (as framework) that challenge essentializing positivist views of "science" as uncovering natural orders. She uses these frameworks to produce a critical analysis of narrative's role in determining Native American DNA v. cultural identity, if not providing the hint of an entire "counterscience" where Native American DNA is not simply limited to the genetic testing of Indigenous bodies and tracing of deep lineage.

*"If the material properties of blood--the red fluid itself are no longer legitimate for the study of race, symbolic blood remains very much at play in twenty-first-century sociopolitical formation of the Indian. The complex semiotics of blood must be understood if we are to guage the opportunites and barriers for Native American DNA to shift the boundaries of race, trive, and indigeneity." (p. 47)*

- Native American DNA is a material-semiotic object which determines more than genetic makeup for Tallbear. Rather in a semantic shift, DNA is increasingly conflated with previous notions of lineage through "blood" and tribal uses of "blood quantum" (pp. 61-63) (and "race" is conflated with "population" in DNA research (p. 38)). These effect of these conflations complicate not only heriditary genealogies, but criteria for tribal enrollments, conceptions of ancestral memory, land soverienty and self-determinism. All of these issues complicate and confuse Indigenous identities as determined by a given tribe, band, or nation.

*"[Re: The Genographic Project] I find evolving narratives encouraging in that they demonstrate that indigene is not vanishing. [Phil] Bluehouse, as a Diné, continues to help constitute culture and knowledge. But does this particular articulation represent a coproduction of indigenous and genetic knowledge prompted too much by the stakes and goals of a corporate genetic-research project?" The Bluehouse account bolsters Genographic's claim that it works collaboratively with indigenous poeple and that its work does not contradict indigenous desires, or even traditional knowledge. But do Diné practices and knowledge shape the constitution of genetic knowledge?..A coproduction analysis is also concerned with 'how sociotechnological formations loop back and change the very terms in which we human beings think about ourselves.'" (p. 173)*

- One important element of Tallbear's critique of the Genographic Project (and other failed research efforts to produce a deep history of human migratory patterns through genetic testing and tracing) is that these initiatives fail to work with and represent the "subjects" of their research through co-production of cultural and genetic knowledges beyond extrapolating individual accounts (Bluehouse) to represent an entire people (Diné). Tallbear points to the ontoepistemological elements of coproduction through Bluehouse's melding of "sociotechnological formations" with traditional Diné knowledge represent his evolving narrative of what it means to be Diné, Indigenous, and human. *Note,* at no point does Tallbear claim to see the evolving, co-produced, narrating and narrated subject of Native American DNA (self-determined or not) as *posthuman*. Though Tallbear's work might be related to other concepts in posthuman/biopolitical thought (e.g., Kroker's *Body Drift* via DNA codedness and identity, Haraway's "situated knowledges" and "hybridities"), *Native American DNA* does not portray its subject matter, nor its subjects/audience through posthuman critique.
