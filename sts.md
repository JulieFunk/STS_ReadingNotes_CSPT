## *The Logic of Care*, Annemarie Mol. 2008.

*"Are 'we', in the 'West', indeed autonomous individuals? The answer is: no, 'we' are not...Some sociologists have studied how in actual practice people in 'free societies' make their choices. They have found that making choices takes a lot of energy, energy that not everybody has to spare or likes to spend on it. They have also found that 'we' end up choosing remarkably similar things. Indeed some scholars have argued that autonomy is not the opposite of heteronomy at all. Instead, they say, making people long for choices and investing in them is a disciplining technique." (p. 4)*

*"The West is not simply Enlightened. It does not just celebrate rationality, autonomy and choice, but has a rich and multi-layered care tradition as well." (p. 5)

*"The scientific tradition that is currently most prominent in health care--that of clinical epidemiology--has not been designed to deal with the unexpected effects of interventions." (p. 99)*

- Mol starts her critique by pressuring the 'Western' tradition of certain Enlightenment ideals which favour traits like rationality, autonomy of the person, and choice. However, these values, as Mol argues, are not the sole ideals espoused in Enlightenment philosophy and there has been an erasure of traditions of care in classical liberalism. Not only does the fixing of certain ideals in time and politic make for ideaological thinking, this also becomes problematic for Mol as the medical sciences have based their practices on many of these fixed Enlightenment ideals in their methodolofy which makes medical philosophy ill-suited to face the unexpected and turbulant nature of patient life that comes into play in clinical practice. This is why Mol suggests a 'logic of care' is necessary in (specifically diabetes) clinical treatment.

- Mol looks presents two competing logics, the 'logic of care' and the 'logic of choice' present in her ethnographic accounts of diabetes treatment and management in on hospital's outpatient clinic in the Netherlands. For Mol, the logic of choice, while an ethical step of from medical paternalism (often seen as forced treatment plans/no options), often ends up rejecting patients lived experiences in its two manifestations: a consumerist logic of choice which centres patient-as-customer, and thereby sells treatment as products without the dialogic process of care, and a civic logic of choice that centres patient-as-citizen which figures the patients' rational accounts of their experiences as removed from the body which can prove counterproductive to treating diseases of the body ("...citizens have to control, tame or transcend their bodies so as to be able to choose" (p. 47))

- Instead, the logic of care is a process (p. 20) which requires open and active dialogue from both doctor and patient, as well as mutual responsibility and expertise (the patient is the expert of their own lives/experiences). The care process is unstable, complex and sometimes unweildy, it "involves a team (of professionals, machines, medication, **bodies**, patients, and relevant others) and tasks are divided between members of that team in ever-changing ways" (p. 21, emphasis my own). While Mol's 'logic of care' often privileges the discourse of *embodiement* and *lived experience*, it is interesting that she often highlights the "body" as something seperate from disease or the patient themselves. In this way, Mol subscribes to the Cartesian language of mind/body split which undermines the logic of care's networked approach to living with chronic illness.
